# Bear and Steady Gene

## Problem description

A gene is represented as a string of length `n` (where nn is divisible by `4`),
composed of the letters `A`, `C`, `T`, and `G`. It is considered to be *steady* if each of the four
letters occurs exactly `n/4` times. For example, `GACT` and `AAGTGCCT` are both steady genes.

Bear Limak is a famous biotechnology scientist who specializes in modifying bear DNA to make it steady.
Right now, he is examining a gene represented as a string ss. It is not necessarily steady. Fortunately,
Limak can choose one (maybe empty) substring of ss and replace it with any substring of the same length.

Modifying a large substring of bear genes can be dangerous. Given a string `s`, can you help
Limak find the length of the smallest possible substring that he can replace to make ss a steady gene?

Note: A substring of a string `S` is a subsequence made up of zero or more *consecutive* characters of `S`.

### Input Format

The first line contains an interger `n` divisible by `4`, denoting the length of a string `s`.
The second line contains a string `s` of length `n`. Each character is one of the four: `A`, `C`, `T`, `G`.

### Constraints

```
4≤n≤500000
n is divisible by 4
```

### Subtask

```
4≤n≤2000 in tests worth 30% points.
```

### Output Format

On a new line, print the minimum length of the substring replaced to make `s` stable.

### Sample Input

```
8
GAAATAAA
```

### Sample Output

```
5
```

### Explanation

One optimal solution is to replace a substring `AAATA` with `TTCCG`, resulting in `GTTCCGAA`.
The replaced substring has length `5`, so we print `5` on a new line.
