## OddEven Kata

#### Goal

Write a program that prints numbers within specified range lets say 1 to 100.
If number is odd print 'Odd' instead of the number.
If number is even print 'Even' instead of number.
Else print number [hint - if number is Prime].

#### Steps

Lets divide into following steps:
* Prints numbers from 1 to 100
* Print "Even" instead of number, if the number is even, means divisible by 2
* Print "Odd" instead of number, if the number is odd, means not divisible by 2 but not divisible by itself too [hint - it should not be Prime]
* Print number, if it does not meet above two conditions, means if number is Prime
* Make method to accept any number of range [currently  we have 1 to 100]
* Create a new method to check Odd/Even/Prime of a single supplied method
