# Circular primes

## Problem description

A number is called a circular prime if it is prime and all of its rotations are primes.

For example, the number `197` has two rotations: `971`, and `719`.  Both of them are prime.
Another example: `1193` is a circular prime, since `1931`, `9311` and `3119` all are also prime.

There are thirteen such primes below `100`: `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11`, `13`, `17`, `31`, `37`, `71`, `73`, `79`, and `97`.

## Task description

How many circular primes are there below `N`?

```
1 <= N <= 1000000
```

Do not solve the task using a built-in function that can accomplish the whole task on its own.

Test Cases

* There are `0` circular primes below `1`.
* There are `4` circular primes below `10`.
* There are `13` circular primes below `100`. 
* There are `25` circular primes below `1000`. 
* There are `33` circular primes below `10000`. 
* There are `43` circular primes below `100000`. 
* There are `55` circular primes below `1000000`.
