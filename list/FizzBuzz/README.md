## The FizzBuzz Kata

* Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
* But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

#### Steps:

Lets divide this into different steps so, we can easily write and test this.

* Print numbers from 1 to 100
* Print "Fizz" instead of number which is divisible by 3
* Print "Buzz" instead of number which is divisible by 5
* Print "FizzBuzz" instead of number which is divisible by both 3 and 5

#### Make more test for accept numbers and provide results

* Create a method to accept single number
* Create test to verify supplied number within the range 1 to 100
* Create test to verify number and return result Fizz or Buzz or FizzBuzz per above criteria
